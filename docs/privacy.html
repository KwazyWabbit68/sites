    <h2>Personal and Sensitive User Data</h2>
	<p>No data is shared with third parties.</p>
	
    <p>SpeedGuard accesses and collects the following types of personal user data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The mobile device's geo location in order to calculate the current and average speed and marking any custom check zones while the app is running, be it in the foreground or in the background.</li>
      <li>The user preferences that are set within the app, such as language, units of measurement and speed limits.</li>
	  <li>Anonymous crash and diagnostics information may be collected for product improvement.</li>
    </ul>
	
    <h2>Data Handling Procedures</h2>
    <p>We take all reasonable measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal user data we collect. We use this data only to provide the services offered by SpeedGuard, no personal user data is shared with third parties.<br/>
		Moreover, any data that may be stored off-device will be anonymous and can therefore not be traced back to the user or his/her device.
	</p>
    
    <a href="#data-retention-and-deletion-policy"><h2>Data Retention and Deletion Policy</h2></a>
	<p>
	  The begin and end locations of user created check zones may be temporarily stored off-device, but always anonymously.<br/>
	  It is not possible for us to trace this info back to the user that created the check zone or his/her device.
	  As such, no personal user data is retained by the application, so there is indeed no account info to delete.
